What is selenium?
Open source tool to automate the web application
Structured framework

Manual Testing:
We do repetitive action
Time Consuming
Complex to perform some calculation

Automation:
Time and efficient
yes all browser
support all os
write any language

Selenium IDE
Selenium IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is the major tool in the Selenium Suite. It is implemented as a Firefox Add-On and as a Chrome Extension. It allows for recording, editing and debugging of functional tests.

Selenium RC (Remote control)
Selenium RC works in such a way that the client libraries can communicate with the Selenium RC Server passing each Selenium command for execution.

Selenium Remote Control (RC) is a server, written in Java, that accepts commands for the browser via HTTP. 

Selenium WebDriver accepts commands (Client API) and sends them to a browser. This is implemented through a browser-specific browser driver, which sends commands to a browser and retrieves results. Most browser drivers actually launch and access a browser application (such as Firefox, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari, or Microsoft Edge).

Selenium WebDriver does not need a special server to execute tests. Instead, the WebDriver directly starts a browser instance and controls it

Selenium Grid allows running tests in parallel on multiple machines and to manage different browser versions and browser configurations centrally

What selenium webdriver can do?
It support all browser
It support all os
It can run in different language-java,js,python,ruby...


What we can do?
can automate excel sheet??No window based(library file -java Apache poi)

Maven ---build in tool

---->Maven serves as an effective automation tool in the market today,allowing you to develop,deploy,and maintain applications with greater ease and efficiency. 

----> The Maven framework for Selenium manages dependencies and generates scripts for automated testing. 

---->many library in it

pom.xml
mvn repository

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId>
    <artifactId>selenium-java</artifactId>
    <version>4.8.3</version>
</dependency>

set the path
System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver","/path/to/chromedriver")
Later we need to add this line to set up the path
WebDriverManager.chromedriver.setup();

Right now we need to include any of above code

 DOM
  Document Object Model
  right click-inspect
  f12
  ctrl+shift+i
Tag
<>
<html>--->tag purple

attribute---->(brown or orange)
attribute value---->blue
text()----->black in colour
